2. **Account-Level Aggregation** (Combined token-level insights at the account level)

**Feature Types Created:**
- **Time-based Aggregations:** Yearly/Quarterly/Monthly software usage trends.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Converted industry labels into numerical values.
- **Feature Interactions:** Captured relationships between different features.
- **Imputation Techniques:**  
  - **Categorical values → "Other"**  
  - **Time-based values → 0**  
  - **Numerical values → 0**  

📌 **Final Basetable Stats:**
- **2991 Unique Accounts**
- **6312 Unique Tokens**
- **396 Features in Final Dataset**
