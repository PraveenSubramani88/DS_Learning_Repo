Great! Let’s walk through your example — predicting house prices using:

* **Linear Regression**
* **Decision Tree**
* **XGBoost**

And explain what happens at each step — especially during **validation**.

## 🏡 Predicting House Prices – Example Workflow

### 📂 1. **Split Your Data**

Suppose you have a dataset of 10,000 houses.

You split it like this:

| Dataset        | Percentage | Purpose                             |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Training Set   | 60–70%     | Train the models                    |
| Validation Set | 15–20%     | Tune hyperparameters / select model |
| Test Set       | 15–20%     | Evaluate final model                |

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step with Your Models

Let’s go step by step and focus on what happens during **validation**:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Train Models on Training Set

You train **each model** on the training data:

* **Linear Regression** learns weights (slope/intercept).
* **Decision Tree** learns splits.
* **XGBoost** builds boosting trees.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Validate Models (on Validation Set)

Now comes the **validation phase** — this is where you:

#### A. **Compare Models**

You ask: "Which model performs better on validation data?"

For example, you check:

* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

| Model             | Validation RMSE |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Linear Regression | 45,000          |
| Decision Tree     | 38,000          |
| XGBoost           | 32,000 ✅        |

XGBoost has the lowest error → it's the current best model.

---

#### B. **Tune Hyperparameters (only on training+validation)**

Let’s say you're using **XGBoost**, and want to tune:

* Number of trees
* Learning rate
* Max depth

You test different combinations on the **validation set**, like:

| Learning Rate | Max Depth | Validation RMSE |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 0.1           | 3         | 35,000          |
| 0.1           | 5         | 32,000 ✅        |
| 0.3           | 5         | 37,000          |

You pick the **best settings based on validation** (e.g., learning rate = 0.1, max depth = 5).

> ❗ You do NOT use test set during this — only training + validation.

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Final Evaluation (on Test Set)

Now that you've chosen **XGBoost** with tuned settings, you run it **once** on the **test set**.

This gives you a **true estimate** of how well your model will do on real data.

---

## 💡 TL;DR — What Happens in Validation?

During **validation**, you:

1. Compare different models (Linear, Tree, XGBoost)
2. Tune hyperparameters (like depth, learning rate)
3. Choose the best model and best settings — **without touching test data**
