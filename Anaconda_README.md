How to activate your environment and launch Jupyter Notebook:

---

## 🚀 Launching Jupyter Notebook with Conda Environment

### 📁 Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd C:\_BigDataCourses\_Projects
```

### 🧪 List Available Conda Environments (Optional: if you know your Env)
```bash
conda info --envs
```

### ✅ Create a New Conda Environment (if needed)
To create a new environment (e.g., `py_env`) with a specific version of Python, run:
```bash
conda create --name agent_env python=3.9
```

You can replace `3.9` with your desired version of Python.

### ✅ Activate Desired Environment (e.g., `agent_env`)
```bash
conda activate agent_env
```

### 🚀 Install Jupyter Notebook (if not installed)
If Jupyter is not already installed in your environment, you can install it by running:
```bash
conda install jupyter
```

### 🚀 Launch Jupyter Notebook
Once your environment is activated and Jupyter is installed, launch it with:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This should open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser, and you can start working on your project!
