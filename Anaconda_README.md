## ü§ñ Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses **labeled data** to train a model to predict either a continuous value (regression) or a category/label (classification).

### üìä Regression (Predict Numbers)

**Example Use Case**: House prices, stock prices, weather forecasting.

**Key Models**:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge/Lasso Regression** (Regularized Linear Models)
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regression** (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- **Neural Networks** (Deep Learning for complex data)

### üè∑Ô∏è Classification (Predict Categories)

**Example Use Case**: Spam detection, disease classification (e.g., cancer vs. non-cancer).

#### üìç Binary Classification (2 Classes)
- **Example**: Spam vs. Not Spam, Disease vs. No Disease
- **Key Models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**

## üß† Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with **unlabeled data** to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures in the data.

### üîç Clustering (Group Similar Things)

**Example Use Case**: Customer segmentation, market basket analysis.

**Key Models**:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**
- **Hierarchical Clustering** (Agglomerative and Divisive)
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- **Mean Shift**
- **Affinity Propagation**
- **Spectral Clustering**
- **Birch Clustering**
- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**

### üî¢ Dimensionality Reduction (Reduce Features)

**Example Use Case**: Reducing features for faster computation, visualizing high-dimensional data.

**Key Models**:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
- **Autoencoders** (Deep Learning for feature reduction)
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**

### üö® Anomaly Detection (Detect Outliers)

**Example Use Case**: Fraud detection, network security.

**Key Models**:
- **Isolation Forest**
- **One-Class SVM**
- **Autoencoders** (Deep Learning for anomaly detection)
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**

## üí° Memory Tips

### Supervised Learning:
- **Supervised Learning** = Learn from **labeled data** to predict values (Regression) or categories (Classification).
  - **Regression** = Predict **numbers** (e.g., house prices).
  - **Classification** = Predict **categories** (e.g., Spam vs. Not Spam).

### Unsupervised Learning:
- **Unsupervised Learning** = Learn from **unlabeled data** to find patterns or structure.
  - **Clustering** = Group **similar data**.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction** = **Reduce features** while preserving important information.
  - **Anomaly Detection** = **Detect outliers**.

### Mnemonics:
- **Regression** = "Predict a **Range** of values".
- **Classification** = "Predict **Categories**".
- **Clustering** = "Group **Similar** things".
- **Anomaly Detection** = "Detect **Outliers**".

### Additional Tips
- Use **visual aids** like mind maps or flowcharts to associate each model with its function.
- Practice with real datasets: Iris (classification), Boston housing (regression), customer data (clustering).
- Create **flashcards**: Write the name of the model on one side, and its function and use case on the other.
